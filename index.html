                        Inova is a international company mostly working with creating innovation ideas. We have helped people all over the word and countinue to expand our work.
                        We have previously had projects focusing on ensuring that more people in the world have access to clean water, worked to collect and donate money to the 
                        poor people, and even helped with building new schools. Our current project is focused on stress in the home office due to Coronavirus (COVID-19). We have 
                        created an idea that will help achieve these goals.

                    <h1>Problem & Solution</h1>
                    <p>
                        In a normal work situation, days with a home office are often experienced as a gift, 
                        something positive. But now that very many are forced into a life with a home office, 
                        and this will last for several months, it is hardly a "gift" that is the feeling many 
                        have. How will this life affect people, and what can be done to make this life the best 
                        it can be?
                    </p>
                    <h2>Solution:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Based on the knowledge that exists, we can state that a not insignificant part of all those 
                        who have to work in such a situation, will develop strong mental ailments and symptoms when 
                        this persists over many weeks. In addition, there is the specific burden that everyone, to 
                        varying degrees, lives with fear of the virus and its consequences for themselves or others. 
                        As the virus spreads, more and more people will know someone who becomes seriously ill and dies 
                        from the virus. At the same time, they cannot participate in ordinary social activities and rituals 
                        to take care of those who are having difficulty. In addition to all this, there are fears related 
                        to the work situation and finances.

                        We will here with some simple advice and tips on how we can organize our work in this situation.</p>
                        
                        <br>
                        
                    <p><span>Establish routines:</span>

                        <li>If you have not already done so, define a separate physical workplace in your home.</li>
                        <li> Create good routines and structure for working hours vs leisure time.</li>
                        <li>Define clear tasks for each day.</li>
                        <li> Maintain good routines for breaks and food.</li>
                        <li>Make sure you have good routines for bedtime and sleep.</li>
                    </p>
                    
                        <br>

                        <p><span>Social contact:</span> 

                        <li>Make sure you have meetings and conversations and do not sit too much alone.</li>
                        <li>Make sure you have meetings that also provide space to talk about how you and those 
                            you meet are feeling today.</li>
                        <li>Accept that we are all affected by this, to varying degrees, and need to talk about 
                            how we feel, not just what we do in terms of work.</li>
                        </p> 
                        
                        
                        <br>

                    <p><span>Physical activity:</span>
                        <br>

                        <li>Set aside time for physical activity every day.</li> 
                        <li>Are you in quarantine and do not want to go out - find something you can do at home.</li> 
                        <li>Not used to exercising you say? Start now. You may have to sit at home for several months.</li> 
                    </p>    
                        
                        <br>

                    <p><span>Handles stress and fear:</span> 
                        <br>

                        <li>Make sure you have up-to-date info on what is happening and how to react if you suspect you 
                            are getting sick - but make a plan for how much you expose yourself to virus news. 
                            They can become a separate "virus" if you do nothing but follow the news feed.</li> 
                        <li>Accept that it is both normal and healthy to feel a little fear in this situation, but 
                            think about what you can do to make life the best it can be.</li> 
                        <li>If the fear becomes strong - talk to someone you trust. It is actually a good help to 
                            talk together, and experience that the person you are talking to listens to you and 
                            confirms your experience.</li>
                        <li>Some people find it helpful to write down their thoughts and feelings about what is happening. 
                            Set aside a little half an hour early in the evening, write down what you are thinking about and 
                            what is causing the unrest - and also write down what you can do to reduce it.</li>

                        <br>

                    <p><span>You who are the leader</span>
                        <br>

                        <li>Schedule regular team meetings and individual meetings for all employees.</li> 
                        <li>Make sure that extra follow-up is given to those who say they are having a hard time.</li> 
                        <li>Be a leader who asks how they are, not just what they have done.</li>
                        <li>It is often helpful to simply ask people "How has your day been?"</li>
                        <li>Establish contact with professional assistance if an employee needs it.</li> 
                    </p> 
                        
                        <br>

                    <p><span>To all of us</span>
                        <br>

                        <li>We will be working in home offices for a relatively long time to come. No one has previous 
                            experience that can tell us exactly how we want to master this. It will depend on a number 
                            of factors: Personal style, available social support, previous experiences, risk profile in 
                            relation to the virus, how we are affected by the virus directly and indirectly, etc.</li>

                        <li>In the midst of all this, we must also work and live. Although some also lose their jobs, 
                            or experience other significant burdens due to the major economic consequences of the virus. 
                            Others will be under strong pressure because they work in sectors that society is completely 
                            dependent on that also function in the crisis.</li>

                        <li>For all of us, it becomes important to create a routine in everyday life and weekends, while 
                            we largely stay at home, which means that the negative consequences for physical and mental 
                            health are minimized. In routines, in structure, there is control, and it is this control that 
                            we all now have to create in a new and for most of us completely unknown reality.</li>

                        <li>Many people will now have a surplus of time, and stress can also be caused by having too little 
                            to do. It is allowed to look at this as an opportunity to do something new, something constructive, 
                            something that gives you positive energy. It can be learning something new, or carpentry the table 
                            you want, or simply just having more time with your loved ones. Then these closest ones may not be 
                            under the same roof, then we have to create routines via video and telephone which means that we not 
                            only maintain but perhaps also strengthen the social ties we have, and are so dependent on.</li>
